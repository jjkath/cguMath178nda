\section{Authentication Results} \label{sectionResults}

In this section, we report authentication performance of HMOG features. We compare the performance of HMOG with keystroke and tap features and report results with fusion.\footnote{See Supplement for the number of genuine and impostor scores used for calculating EERs in this paper.} Finally, we present our findings on why HMOG features achieve lower EERs during walking. %

%
HMOG features extracted from both accelerometer and gyroscope outperformed those extracted from individual sensors. %
HMOG features from magnetometer performed consistently worse than accelerometer and gyroscope features with all verifiers, in both sitting and walking conditions. Combining magnetometer features with features from accelerometer and gyroscope did not improve performance.

%
Resistance features outperformed stability features in both walking and sitting conditions (and also had higher Fisher score, see Figure~\ref{fig:fisherFeatures}). This suggests that the ability of resistance features to discriminate between users is higher than that of stability features. In fact, feature selection on HMOG with 10-CV  resulted in selecting resistance features only.
%
In some cases, using PCA after feature selection further lowered EERs. Table \ref{tab:individualperformance} summarizes the sensors and feature selection/transformation that led to the lowest EERs.

In Figure~\ref{fig:hmogAllVerifiersSitWalk}, we show the EERs of all verifiers under sitting and walking conditions, when the authentication scans varied between 20 and 140 seconds. Among the three verifiers, SM overall had lower EERs for both sitting and walking conditions and therefore we present the results only with SM hereafter. %

\paragraph{Comparison of HMOG with Keystroke Dynamics and Tap Features}
%
%
Tap features and HMOG features in walking condition performed better than keystroke dynamics features; HMOG in sitting outperforms keystroke dynamics for shorter scans and is comparable for longer scans (see Figure \ref{fig:walkVSsitAllSM}). 

HMOG features outperformed tap features in walking condition, while tap outperformed HMOG in sitting. 
The performance of tap and keystroke dynamics features did not change significantly between sitting and walking. However, the performance of HMOG improved considerably (up to 6.11\%) during walking. %

\paragraph{Fusion of HMOG, Tap, and Keystroke Features} We used SM verifier and performed score-level fusion with the following feature combinations: \{HMOG, tap, keystroke dynamics\};  \{tap, keystroke dynamics\}; and \{tap, HMOG\}. Detailed fusion results for sitting  and walking conditions are presented in figures \ref{fig:sitFusionSM} and~\ref{fig:walkFusionSM}, respectively. The lowest EERs achieved with fusion are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:fusionperformance},v and the corresponding DET curves for fusion on 60- and 120-second scan lengths are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DETS}. %

Our results show that: (1) for both walking and sitting conditions, score-level fusion of all signals led to the lowest EER; and (2) fusing HMOG with tap features led to a decrease in EERs and either outperformed (in the case of walking and shorter scans in sitting) or was comparable (in the case of longer scans in sitting) to fusion of tap and keystroke dynamics (see figures~\ref{fig:sitFusionSM}) and \ref{fig:walkFusionSM}). Both (1) and (2) indicate that HMOG provides additional distinctiveness to that of tap and keystroke dynamics, especially in walking condition.
